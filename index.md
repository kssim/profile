# About Me
I'm a software developer who likes traveling and photography, coffee and books.  
I like Linux and python, and I'm interested in automation, non-binary code and system architecture.  
I want to write code like writing, and I don't like inefficient, unproductive things.  
I'm interested in new technologies and languages. And I'm also interested in improving the inconvenience of working with developers.  
I want to develop a program for a long time. :)
